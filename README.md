## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.8+ and npm

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Generate the required images:
   - Use your OpenAI API key (stored in `.env`) to generate the images for:
     - `public/images/speaker-silhouette.png` (see placeholder text file for prompt)
     - `public/images/testimonial-1.jpg` (see placeholder text file for prompt)
     - `public/images/testimonial-2.jpg` (see placeholder text file for prompt)
     - `public/images/testimonial-3.jpg` (see placeholder text file for prompt)
   
   - You can use the OpenAI API directly or a tool like DALL-E 3 to generate these images

3. Replace the placeholder font:
   - Replace `public/fonts/Aeonik.otf` with the actual Aeonik font or a similar alternative

### Running the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the website.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment to Vercel

1. Push the repository to GitHub (as specified in your instructions)
2. Link the GitHub repository to Vercel
3. Set up environment variables in Vercel:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (for any server-side image generation)
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS` (G-NHP0V7DMK4)

## Important Notes

- The API key is stored in `.env` which is included in the `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being exposed when pushing to GitHub
- You need to manually set up the environment variables in Vercel for deployment
- Google Analytics is already integrated with the tracking ID G-NHP0V7DMK4
