### Installation

1. Install dependencies:

2. Generate the required images:
   - Use your OpenAI API key (stored in `.env`) to generate the images for:
     - `public/images/speaker-silhouette.png` (see placeholder text file for prompt)
     - `public/images/testimonial-1.jpg` (see placeholder text file for prompt)
     - `public/images/testimonial-2.jpg` (see placeholder text file for prompt)
     - `public/images/testimonial-3.jpg` (see placeholder text file for prompt)
   
   - You can use the OpenAI API directly or a tool like DALL-E 3 to generate these images

3. Replace the placeholder font:
   - Replace `public/fonts/Aeonik.otf` with the actual Aeonik font or a similar alternative

### Running the Development Server

npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the website.

### Building for Production

```

## Deployment to Vercel

1. Push the repository to GitHub (as specified in your instructions)
2. Link the GitHub repository to Vercel
