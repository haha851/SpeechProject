This is a placeholder for the speaker silhouette image.

This should be an image of a silhouette of a person delivering a speech, possibly at a podium or on stage.
The image should have a transparent background so it blends well with the purple/indigo gradient.

You can generate this using your OpenAI API key with DALL-E 3, with a prompt like:
"A sleek, modern silhouette of a confident speaker at a podium, elegant pose, minimalist design, transparent background, professional business presentation"
